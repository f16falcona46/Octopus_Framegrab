"Input" means to provide fresh buffers, that is to say, both producers and consumers pop off their corresponding inputs.
"Output"s are likewise; both producers and consumers push buffers on their corresponding outputs.
Therefore, the "Input" buffer of a producer must be the "Output" buffer of a consumer, and vice versa.

StopStreaming() should stop the streaming, but it may transfer one more buffer before it ends.

Buffers and buffer queues are not owned by the streamers. The user of these classes must construct, keep track of, and destroy them.

Note: any changes made to streamer instances may not be applied to them until the streaming is stopped, and the Setup() function run again.
